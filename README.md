# Maternal-Health-Outcome-Prediction
## Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting maternal health outcomes by analyzing various health indicators, with a specific focus on systolic blood pressure. By employing machine learning techniques and data analysis, my aim is to contribute to the improvement of maternal healthcare services.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to predict maternal health outcomes based on comprehensive health datasets.
- **Focus on Systolic Blood Pressure**: Highlights the impact of systolic blood pressure among other factors on maternal health outcomes.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations of the data and the factors affecting maternal health.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced datasets

  
## Project Structure
The analysis workflow is structured as follows:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the relationships between different variables, especially focusing on systolic blood pressure.
- **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models to predict maternal health outcomes.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models and their ability to accurately predict outcomes.
